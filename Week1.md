# Week 1

## Weekly Goals

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## Plans to achieve

1. Getting the hang of TDD through Boris Bikes challenge and attending the workshop. Reinforcing this knowledge by independently working through the weekend challenge
2. Pairing for 3 hours every afternoon with a different pair each time
3. Work through the debugging exercises and attend the workshop
4. Gain an understanding through research and working on exercises. Reinforce this knowledge throughout the week on the pairing challenges and at the end of the week with the weekend challenge

## Evidence

1. Repositories with commits to show process. [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/Hyan18/boris-bikes-2) and weekend challenge: [Airport](https://github.com/Hyan18/airport_challenge)
2. Worked with a different pair each day on Boris Bikes challenge: [First two days](https://github.com/Hyan18/Boris_Bikes) and [End of the week](https://github.com/Hyan18/boris-bikes-2)
3. Went through the debugging exercises which can be seen [here](https://github.com/Hyan18/Debugging_Exercises)
4. Went through practicals, found in the following repos: [Birthdays](https://github.com/Hyan18/birthdays) and [OOD-encapsulation](https://github.com/Hyan18/OOD-encapsulation)

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- Some of the practicals I didn't fully complete (Encapsulation and Cohesion) but I think I got a good understanding of the general concepts and it will be something we will be practicing in future projects

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

- You don't have to finish everything. What's most important is going through the process and learning from it
- Sometimes I would forget to make commits so - make sure to make regular commits (after each red green factor step)
- Do more research and get a better understanding of mocking (doubles)
- We had a Debugging workshop on tuesday and a TDD workshop on thursday but I ended up doing the TDD exercises on wednesday before the workshop and then the debugging exercises afterwards. I should better structure my learning around the workshops as I think it would have been more useful to go through the relevant exercises after the relevant workshop.
