# Week 4

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a simple web app with a database
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

## Plans to achieve

1. Pairing challenge (bookmark manager) and weekend challenge (Chitter challenge)
2. Using capybara test frameworks
3. SQLZoo

## Evidence

1. Bookmark manager pairing challenge ([Monday](https://github.com/denriquem/bookmark_manager), [Tuesday](https://github.com/Hyan18/bookmark-manager-tue), [Wednesday](https://github.com/DawidSzpener/Bookmark_manager_wednesday), [Thursday](https://github.com/Hyan18/bookmark-manager-thu.git), [Friday](https://github.com/Hyan18/bookmark-manager-fri)) and [Chitter challenge](https://github.com/Hyan18/chitter-challenge)
2. Used a debugging process in the challenges
3. 
* Worked through exercises 0 to 4 from [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/)
* Went through an entity relationship diagrams [practical](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/databases/entity_relationship_diagrams.md)
* Attended [database domain modelling](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-4/domain_modelling_student_directory_using_crc_cards) with [solutions](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/week-4/domain_modelling_student_directory_using_crc_cards/COACH_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- Yes but I could have been more strict about my debugging process for database applications

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

- Make sure to be using [RESTful routes](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/rest.md)
- Didn't have that much time this weekend but if I had more time I would have liked to try using an ORM
- Saw a nicely formatted [README](https://github.com/Hyan18/bookmark-manager-fri/blob/master/README.md) during my pairing which made me think more about them - should try to write better READMEs which include:
* What the program does
* How to install and run the program
* How to run tests
* Bonus stuff (approach, rooms for improvement, etc.)
