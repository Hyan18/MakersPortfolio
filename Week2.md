# Week 2

## Weekly Goals

1. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
2. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
3. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
4. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Plans to achieve

1. Attend workshop and work through exercises
2. Understand concept through practical and reinforce knowledge in pairing challenge and weekend challenge
3. Look through practicals and do additional research
4. Monday code review and attend feedback workshop

## Evidence

1. Attended workshop (repo [here](https://github.com/Hyan18/Domain-Modelling)) and worked through exercises [here](https://github.com/Hyan18/Dependency_Injection)
2. Practial completed [here](https://github.com/Hyan18/Dependency_Injection). [Pairing](https://github.com/BenSheridanEdwards/Oystercard) and [weekend challenge](https://github.com/Hyan18/takeaway-challenge) repos with regular commits
3. Was not able to go through the forwarding and polymorphism practicals but unintentionally applied some of these skills in the pairing and weekend challenge
4. Reviewed someone else' code with initial thoughts then with the aid of the rubric

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- Didn't have time to complete the OO Relationships (Forwarding, Polymorphism) practical but from my initial look and thoughts from others I applied these skills in the pairing and weekend challenge
- This week was better structured by the fact that the coach outlined the most important concepts to understand this week so I went through them in more detail

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

- Think having better structure aided in my learning so in the future I should ask coaches if they have any additional guidelines
- Better organise my pairing work by having a specific directory for each day of the week
