# Week 3

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
4. Explain the MVC pattern

## Plans to achieve

1. Pairing challenge and weekend challenge
2. Attend debugging workshop
3. Work through practicals and attend workshop
4. Research and understand it in the context of the web apps I am going to build 

## Evidence

1. 
* Started with a very simple web app ([here](https://github.com/Hyan18/intro-to-the-web))
* Then worked on a slightly more complex Battle app in my pairing throughout the week ([Tuesday](https://github.com/Hyan18/battle-tue/), [Wednesday](https://github.com/IngramCapa/battle), [Thursday](https://github.com/Hyan18/Battle), [Friday](https://github.com/HarryMumford/battlegame))
* Finally, independently worked on a [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/Hyan18/rps-challenge) app
2. [Workshop](https://github.com/Hyan18/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/debugging_2) completed
3. Attended [process modelling, applied to HTTP request/response cycle workshop](https://github.com/Hyan18/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/process_modelling), worked through practicals ( [Servers](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/servers_and_clients/servers.md), [Clients](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/servers_and_clients/clients.md)), and used GET/POST requests in all the apps built this week
4. Read through the relevant [pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/mvc.md) and in the context of the apps I built
the Model lies in the lib folder holding the logic, the View lies in the views folder holding the erb files which contain HTML/CSS, and the Controller is the app.rb which is what pulls the Model and View together

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- Mostly, if I had more time I would have liked to use a bit more CSS

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

- Ask more questions - I was a bit unsure about the MVC model in the middle of the week so I asked a coach during the workshop and was quickly directed to the [pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/mvc.md) which saved some time
