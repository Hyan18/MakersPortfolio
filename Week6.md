# Week 6

## Weekly Goals

1. Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
2. Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
3. Run stand-ups and retrospectives
4. Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
5. Give and receive meaningful code review


## Plans to achieve

* Run regular standups (9:30 and 14:00) and retrospectives (17:00/18:00)
* Turn specification into user stories
* Never work on the master (always use branches)

## Evidence

* [Repository](https://github.com/HarryMumford/MareBnB)
* [Standups](https://github.com/Hyan18/MakersPortfolio/tree/master/images/standups)
* [Retrospectives](https://github.com/Hyan18/MakersPortfolio/tree/master/images/retros)


## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- Yes, we got the minimum viable product finished really early (tuesday) and ended up finishing all of the headline specifications.
- We left all of the CSS to the end so didn't get that much done so given more time I would have liked to do more CSS

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

- Use github's review system - we ended up talking about pull requests but most of the time didn't make any comments on github which makes it look like we just merged without a review
- Started by doing our merges the next morning but found it better to do it at the end of the day (on the day) instead
- Used an ORM for the first time and will carry on doing so going forward as it makes code a lot more simpler and look cleaner
