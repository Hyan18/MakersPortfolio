# Week 5

## Weekly Goals

1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language

## Plans to achieve

1. Test drive Thermostat web app using Jasmine testing framework
2. Start by rewriting simple programs that I have written in Ruby into Javascript and regularly looking at documentation

## Evidence

1. Thermostat ([Tuesday](https://github.com/kealanheena/thermostat), [Wednesday](https://github.com/TuanNguyen1010/Thermostat.git), [Thursday](https://github.com/JonathanPalma-code/Thermostat.git), [Friday](https://github.com/Hyan18/thermostat-fri.git))
2. Rewrote [Fizzbuzz in javascript](https://github.com/Hyan18/Fizzbuzz-with-Javascript) and then had the [Bowling challenge](https://github.com/Hyan18/bowling-challenge) on the weekend. Also worked through [Javascripting workshopper](https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting) repo [here](https://github.com/Hyan18/Javascripting)

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- Mostly. Overall think the week went well as I had never done any Javascript before - I think I made good progress

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

- Still need to be making sure to write READMEs
- Need to take some more time to get an understanding of AJAX requests
