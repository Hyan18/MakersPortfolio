# Week 7

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a front-end app in Javascript
2. Work competently in Javascript
3. Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

## Plans to achieve

1. Pairing challenge (Notes App) and weekend challenge (News Summary/Chitter API Frontend)
2. Make sure to use linters throughout challenges
3. Research about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript and attend workshop on the JS Event Loop

## Evidence

1. Pairing challenge with a new pair every day: ([Mon](https://github.com/ajbacon/notes_app), [Tue](https://github.com/Hyan18/notes-app-tue), [Wed](https://github.com/HarryMumford/notes-application), [Thu](https://github.com/jj49411/notes-app), [Fri](https://github.com/JonathanPalma-code/NoteApp-JavaScript)) and weekend challenge [here](https://github.com/Hyan18/news-summary-challenge)
2. Started off with linters with my pairs but became difficult when switching to various pairs. Also attended workshop on the Javascript Module Pattern
3. Went through [exercises](https://hackmd.io/cnH7BqucQ7yzqnLiqmizXw) on asynchronous javascript and attended workshop on Javascript Event Loop (gaining an understanding of the call stack (LIFO) and message queue (FIFO))

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

- 'Work competently in Javascript' was quite a broad goal so it is hard to judge if I really meet the goal. Other than that I think I made a lot of progress in learning this week especially during the weekend challenge when we were required to make asynchronous requests to APIs.

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

- When the task becomes more difficult it is all the more reason to take breaks
